# polls
### this is poll app from [django documentation tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial01/) ###


#### Final goal:
+ to convert this app to an API using [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)


#### What I have done so far :
  + studied django tutorial docs and created the polls app
  + did [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) tutorial part 1 and got familiar with [Serialization](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/1-serialization/)
  + mapped the structure of the serialization to the polls app, it current can show some data in json format on 'polls/api/' path
  
  
#### (probable)Todo:
  + Review
  + study [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) tutorial part to get familiar with [Request and Responses](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/2-requests-and-responses/)
